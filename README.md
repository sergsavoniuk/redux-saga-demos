[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sergsavoniuk/redux-saga-demos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/sergsavoniuk/redux-saga-demos)

<hr />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

You can view a live demo over at https://redux-saga-demos.herokuapp.com/

This repository contains a collection of apps that implemented using library Redux-Saga. Redux-Saga is a library that aims to make application side effects easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.

## Features

- **React** — 16.8
- **Redux** — managing application state
- **Redux-Saga** — managing side effects
- **React Router** — declarative routing
- **Reselect** — selector library for Redux
- **Styled Components** — styling components using tagged template literals
- **Jest/Enzyme** — testing components
- **Service Worker** — Workbox (for adding offline support)
- **lint-staged/husky** — run linters on git staged files, git hooks

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/sergsavoniuk/redux-saga-demos.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`<br />
2. Move to the appropriate directory: `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`.<br />
3. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies.<br />
4. Run `yarn` or `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
